How to navigate through your computer and create new files directly from the command-line.\n\n2. The boilerplate used to create our websites\n___\nSteps:\n\n- **Command Line Navigation**\nAs developers we tend to use the command line quite a bit so it is quicker to use it for easy commands as well, such as creating folders, or repositories, and opening them. \n\n\nGo ahead and open your command-line now:\n On Mac this is called Terminal or iTerm.\n On Windows it's called Command Prompt.\n\n\nCongratulations! your in your \"home folder\"\n Let's see what's inside.\n  If you're using windows type in:\n\n`dir`\n\nIf you're using a mac, type in:\n\n`ls`\n\nGreat, now we want to navigate to other folders.\nto do that type in the folder name after writing cd.\nlike this:\n\n`cd ~folderName`\n\nif we want to enter our desktop we will write:\n\n`cd desktop`\n\nto go back we will write two dots in the foldername space, like this:\n\n`cd ..`\n\n- Creating folders and files\n\nLet's create a coding folder which will hold all of our projects.\n\nlets enter our desktop once more by writing:\n\n`cd desktop`\n\ncreate a new folder called \"code\" by writing:\n\n`mkdir code`\n\n\nThis will create a new folder called \"code\".\n\nNow, lets enter our \"code\" folder by writing:\n\n`cd code`\n\nthen, create a \"lesson1\" folder using mkdir:\n\n`mkdir lesson1`\n\n\nGreat!\nLets start our first project!\n___\nto do this we will create two files: index.html and style.css.\n(Windows):\n\n```javascript\ntouch index.html\ntouch style.css\n```\n(Mac):\n\n```javascript\nnul index.html\nnul style.css\n```\n___\n- Downloading our code editor\n[Click here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)\n\nWe want to download the Visual Studio Code.  \nclick on the purple link box, install the VS Code that fits your computer and afterwards come back to this lesson :)\n___\n- HTML Setup\n\nMost of our projects will have an HTML file named index.html.  \n The index file is the main file that gets run in our browser and it's where we connect all our other files (if we have them).  \n Go ahead and copy/paste the following code inside of our index.html file:\n\n```javascript\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n    <title>Page Title</title></head>\n                    \n  <body>\n                    \n  </body>\n                    \n</html>\n```\n\nThis is our \"HTML boilerplate\". Boilerplate code is what we call code that we use to set-up our projects.  \nThe html wraps our whole HTML document and inside of it we have our head and our body.  \nThe head is for \"logistics\", like the title of our page and linking in other files.  \nThe body is for the actual content of our page. Go ahead and add the following code inside of the body:\n\n```javascript\n<h1>Hello Presentense!</h1>\n```\n\nLastly, open your HTML file in Google Chrome.\n- open Google Chrome.\n- Click (Windows) Ctrl+o, (Mac) Command+o\n- enter your lesson1 folder and choose your index.html file\n___\n**CSS Magic**  \nRemember what we said about the logistic part inside our *html*?\nThe header!  \nlets use this to attach our css to the index.html!  \nto do this we will *link* our css inside the header.\n\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n<head>\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"style.css\" />\n  <title></title>\n</head>\n```\nWe used the `<link>` tag which in it we entered two more tags.\n1. `type`\n2. `href`\n\nthe `type` tag helps our html understand what we is linking\nthe `href` tag helps our html understand what is the name of our linked file\n\nSince both index.html and style.css are in the same folder, we can just write style.css.\n\nLets start the magic!\n\ninside your `style.css`\n\nwrite this:\n\n```javascript\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n```\n\n**And now lets see you!**"}
