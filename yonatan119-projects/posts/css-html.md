Your first project will be from our skills build platform.

[Click here!](https://bundles.yourlearning.ibm.com/skills/ngo/#RKEMERVPMPMY1DGX/EKVDPYPKGMKV155G)

First:
go through the links in the "Want some theory first" section and create a webpage according to the instructions.
**if you went through the lesson, you know everything need to make this work. try doing as much on your own but use their guidance if you have a hard time**

Second:
at the bottom of the page you have a mockup of a web page, lets create it by ourselves!

Feel free to play around, it does not have to look exactly like the image.
whatever you make, is good.
the important thing is to *hands on* start writing code and understanding this subject.
If you need another project, let us know!
