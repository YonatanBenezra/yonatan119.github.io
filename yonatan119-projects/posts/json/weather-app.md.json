The user should be able to search for a city and save it to favorites (locally, a server is not required. \nWe expect to see 2 pages in this app. (weather page and favorites page).\nUse the [material UI library](https://material-ui.com/)\n___\n**API**\nThe API that you\u2019ll use for this app is \u200b[AccuWeather API\u200b](https://developer.accuweather.com.  \nPlease signup and create a new app in order to get an API key. \n\nYou will use 3 endpoints: \n- [\u200blocation autocomplete](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/autocomplete\u200b for the search field \n- \u200b[get current weather\u200b](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-current-conditions-api/apis/get/currentconditions/v1/%7BlocationKey%7D) and [5-day daily forecast\u200b](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-forecast-api/apis/get/forecasts/v1/daily/5day/%7BlocationKey%7D). Please read those API docs. \nNOTE: this API is limited to 50 requests per day. Save the responses and use them locally during development. \n___\n**GOALS**\n- Add features and customize the design. \n- Readability - Your code should be readable and self-explanatory with minimum comments. Remove any unused code, console logs, and files. Use logical project structure and code separation. \n___\n**SPECS** \n- Create a header with navigation icons/links/buttons for main and favorites screen. \n- The main screen (weather details) will be composed of a search field to search a \n- location\u2019s weather by city name. And below it, the current weather and a 5-day forecast of the searched location. A location should have an indication if it\u2019s already saved in favorites, and a button to add/remove from favorites (it can be the same button). \n- Display Tel Aviv weather by default. \n- Favorites screen will be composed of a list of favorite locations. Each location should \nhave an ID, name and current weather. Clicking on a favorite will navigate to the main screen showing the details of that location. \n- Searching should be done in English letters only \n- State management is a must! \n- Responsive design is a must! (flexbox/grid will give you extra points ). \n- Error handling is a must! (can be done with toast, modal). \n___\n**Extensions** \n- Set the default location by using the \u200b[Geolocation API\u200b](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). you will need another API endpoint for this: \u200b[get location key by lat/lon](https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/geoposition/search)\u200b. \n- Add dark/light theme support (add toggle button in the header). \n- Add Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle button. \n- Add animations (with good taste)."}
