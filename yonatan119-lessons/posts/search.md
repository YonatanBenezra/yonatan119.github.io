**How to google**
This might be the most important in this course.

As a developer you tackle a lot of problems you need to solve and sometimes, other people solved the same exact problem already.
It might sound funny, but searching the web is a very important skill.   
there are a couple of tips that may help you search better:
- Don't be afraid to search.
- when searching for an answer, look on which site it was published.
- understand what the solution is before just copying it, this will save you some time.
- search in google, but not only, there are all kinds of amazing sites with answers to many dev problems.

Lets talk about what sites we want to look for when searching google:
- **[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)**
- **[W3](https://www.w3schools.com/)**
- **[dev.to](https://dev.to/)**
- **[Medium](https://medium.com/)**
There are many more sites, these four are just a small group of main sites that will help you find answers.

**Documentation**
For most of the technologies there are very useful documentations, so if you don't find you answer on one of the search engines, check the documentation.

As much as there is not much to say about googling or searching on the web, It is a very important tool.
If you have the time and desire, you can find online all the material you need and it is just a question of time when you will become a fullstack developer, or basically anything today!

I hope you get the most from what the search engine world has to offer.
**Good luck**
